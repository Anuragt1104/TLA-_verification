\* Liveness test configuration: 5 nodes (80% honest, 20% Byzantine)
\* Smaller config to make liveness checking tractable
\* Tests: 20% Byzantine resilience claim exactly

\* Use LiveSpec for fairness conditions
SPECIFICATION LiveSpec

\* Safety Invariants
INVARIANT TypeOK
INVARIANT NoDoubleFinalize
INVARIANT ChainConsistency

\* Liveness Properties (with bounded depth for tractability)
\* Note: These may not complete - will use bounded checking
PROPERTY EventualCoverage
