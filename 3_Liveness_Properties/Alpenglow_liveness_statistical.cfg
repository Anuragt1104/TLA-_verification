\* Statistical Liveness Test: 8 nodes for realistic network size
\* - 8 nodes: 7 honest (87.5%), 1 Byzantine (12.5%)
\* - Tests liveness properties via simulation mode
\* - Runs 1M random traces of depth 50
\* - Provides statistical confidence for EventualCoverage, EventualSlowFinalization
\* - Minimal disk usage (simulation doesn't save full state space)

SPECIFICATION LiveSpec

\* Safety checks during simulation
INVARIANT TypeOK
INVARIANT NoDoubleFinalize
