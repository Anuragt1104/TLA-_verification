    Nodes = {n1, n2, n3, n4, n5, n6}
    Honest = {n1, n2, n3, n4, n5}
    Byzantine = {n6}
    Slots = {0, 1, 2, 3}

    DeltaFast = 1
    DeltaSlow = 2

\* Final comprehensive test: 6 nodes (83% honest, 17% Byzantine)
\* This configuration balances:
\* - Reasonable runtime (4-8 hours vs 12-20 for 10 nodes)
\* - Good coverage with 4 slots
\* - Tests resilience close to 20% Byzantine
\* - Tests fast path (80% = 4.8/6 nodes, achievable with 5 honest)
\* - Tests slow path (60% = 3.6/6 nodes, achievable with 4 honest)
