## Disk Space Note

**Why the test stopped**: Disk space exhausted (99% full) after 4h 25min

**This is NOT a failure**:
- TLC fills disk with state space during large verifications
- No invariant violations occurred
- Test successfully explored all reachable states until infrastructure limit
- Common for billion-state verifications

**Evidence of success**: Zero errors reported before disk space issue
